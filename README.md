# Web Scraping Sandbox

This is my sandbox where I practiced Puppeteer, PQueue, and CheerioJS.

### Usage Instructions

Install dependencies and run the web-scraper using the following commands:

```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

Please Note: For viewing Puppeteer outputs, make sure the "start" script on package.json is updated to reflect the file you wish to run. For example:

```
"start": "node puppeteer/stockScraper.mjs",
```

or

```
"start": "node puppeteer/cosScraper3.mjs",
```

and so on.
